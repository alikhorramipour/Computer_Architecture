<msg type="warning" file="Xst" num="737" delta="old" >Found <arg fmt="%d" index="1">1</arg>-bit latch for signal &lt;<arg fmt="%s" index="2">output</arg>&gt;. Latches may be generated from incomplete case or if statements. We do not recommend the use of latches in FPGA/CPLD designs, as they may lead to timing problems.

<msg type="info" file="Xst" num="2371" delta="old" >HDL ADVISOR - Logic functions respectively driving the data and gate enable inputs of this latch share common terms. This situation will potentially lead to setup/hold violations and, as a result, to simulation problems. This situation may come from an incomplete case statement (all selector values are not covered). You should carefully review if it was in your intentions to describe such a latch.
